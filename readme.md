The objective of this app was to create a platform where football enthusiasts can go on to find out where in Singapore there are live football telecasts. This could be in bars or country clubs or other venues. 

There is a user login functionality to allow users to review the venues. (But this was not completed in this project).

Ideally, I would like to add a means to make reservations to these venues from the app.# Unit-2-Project
