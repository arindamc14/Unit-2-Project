The objective of this app was to create a platform where football enthusiasts can go on to find out where in Singapore there are live football telecasts. This could be in bars or country clubs or other venues. 

There is a user login functionality. If anyone has already signed up and is logged in, he or she can add reviews to the venues. 

Ideally, I would like to add a means to make reservations to these venues from the app.
